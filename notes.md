# WikiPathways styling
Talk about Pvjs version used being the new one and is just barebones styling

# Speed increases
- Still slow because the WikiPathways webservice API (to get GPML) is slow
  - Can see this from the general speed decease on second visit
- Can make it faster still by using stateless functional components

# Pvjs dev
- Note that it is still in beta
- Detail steps to be taken to get it out of beta
  - Fix cross browser issues
  - Full testing
  - Improve styles
